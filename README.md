# CovidProfolioProject-SQL

I download data of confirmed global Covid 19 death and vaccine data to study geographical distribution and trend.
I use Microsoft SQL Server to store and manage data and extracted data using SQL query. 
I also create a dashboard on Tableau that shows death count by continent, time series and map of infections by country.
