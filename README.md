# CovidProfolioProject-SQL

In this project, I download data of confirmed global Covid 19 death and vaccine data.
The goal for this project is to study geographical distribution and trend.
I use Microsoft SQL Server to store and manage data and extracted data using SQL query. 
I also create a [dashboard](https://github.com/yanruchen/CovidProfolioProject-SQL/blob/main/Covid_Dashboard.png) on Tableau that shows death count by continent, time series and map of infections by country.
