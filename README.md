# CovidProfolioProject-SQL

In this project, I download data of confirmed global Covid 19 death and vaccine data.

The goal for this project is to study geographical distribution and trend.

I use Microsoft SQL Server to store and manage data and extracted data using SQL query. 

I also create a [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yanru.chen/viz/shared/RY3CTNXG4) on Tableau that shows death count by continent, time series and map of infections by country.
